What do I need?
===============
* You should always install the @CBA mod folder by copying it to your ArmA II installation
  folder.

* If you have a "merged" or "seperate", Combined Operations installation with both the old ArmA II
  content and the new Arrowhead expansion, you're done - you only need the @CBA mod folder.

* If you only have a standalone Operation Arrowhead installation, you need both the @CBA
  and the @CBA_OA folders loaded.
  
* If you only have the older ArmA II installed, you need both the @CBA and the
  @CBA_A2 folders loaded.
